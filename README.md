# pyo-plug

Audio plugin using the python module pyo to create the dsp.

This plug-in allows the user to build his own signal processing chains with the python module **pyo**.
It presents a text editor to write code that can be compiled on the fly.

## Installation

Python 2.7 and pyo must be installed on the system before using the plugin.

[Python 2.7 download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/) (must be 32-bit on Windows)

[Pyo download page](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/)

Then, download the plugin from the [Release page](https://github.com/belangeo/pyo-plug/releases) 
and save it in the local VST folder of the system.

* For Windows users: because pyo is only compiled for 32-bit python, the plugin is 32-bit only on Windows.

## Donation

This project is developed by Olivier BÃ©langer on his free time to provide a 
fully integrated Python dsp module for sound exploration and music composition.
